    Route::get('/notifications/unread-count', [NotificationController::class, 'unreadCount']);
    Route::post('/notifications/{id}/read', [NotificationController::class, 'markAsRead']);

    Route::delete('/notifications/{id}', [NotificationController::class, 'destroy']);
});
```

#### Teacher Routes

// In your controller
NotificationService::notifyTeacherAboutSubmission($classwork, $student);
```

```php
use App\Services\NotificationService;

// After creating classwork
NotificationService::notifyStudentsAboutClasswork($classwork);
```

#### Custom Notification
```php
use App\Services\NotificationService;

NotificationService::notifyUser(
    $userId,
    'custom',
    'Custom Title',
    'Custom message here',
    [
        'url' => '/some-url',
        'additional_data' => 'value'
    ]
);
```

## UI/UX Features

  - Delete button

### Auto-Refresh

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to consider:
1. **Email Notifications**: Send email for important notifications

5. **Admin Announcements**: Dedicated admin interface for creating announcements
6. **Notification Categories**: Filter by type (submissions, materials, announcements)
7. **Archive Feature**: Archive old notifications instead of deleting
8. **Read Receipts**: Track when users viewed notifications

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Teacher receives notification when student submits work

## Maintenance

### Database Cleanup
Consider adding a scheduled job to clean old notifications:

```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Delete notifications older than 90 days
    $schedule->call(function () {
        Notification::where('created_at', '<', now()->subDays(90))->delete();
    })->daily();
}
```
